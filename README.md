# C# Sorting Algorithms


This solution is an implementation of the common sorting algorithms in C# programming language. Currently, the following sort algorithms are implemented:

  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort


All sorting algorithms so far were implemented based on the understanding received from the Youtube videos by 'My Code School' (https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool/)
